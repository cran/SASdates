Description: Converts the dates to different 'SAS' date formats. In 'SAS' dates are a special case of 
             numeric values. Each day is assigned a specific numeric value, starting from January 1, 1960.
             This date is assigned the date value 0, and the next date has a date value of 1 and so on.
             The previous days to this date are represented by -1 , -2 and so on. With this approach, 
             'SAS' can represent any date in the future or any date in the past. There are many date 
             formats used in 'SAS' to represent date-time. Here, we try to develop functions which will
             convert the date to different 'SAS' date formats.
